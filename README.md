**Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning**

**Project Overview**
This project leverages Deep Learning, a subset of Machine Learning, to detect brain tumors using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Given the massive amount of data generated by the healthcare sector, this project aims to enhance patient outcomes by accurately identifying brain tumors from MRI images.

**Key Features**
1. **Data Utilization:** Uses MRI images of the brain.
2. **Deep Learning Models:** Implements models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and VGG16.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Assesses models based on accuracy, validation loss, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
